# Marty Sim

Barebones, barely working simulator for AUV Marty.

Work in progress.

Contains scenario files that should be run with [stonefish_ros](https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish_ros).    
This package contains a translation layer that should work out of the box with output from the TVMC and the rest of system. 

It should also output sensor data as expected by the system, along with a realistic amount of noise added on top.
